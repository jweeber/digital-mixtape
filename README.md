###*connect through music. again*

##Concept

As cassette tapes became more popular and accessible in the 1980s, mixtapes were born. A symbol of youth culture at the time, the mixtape became not just a recorded set of songs, but a way to connect with others using music and art. Whether your friend was going through a breakup or you needed a way to express your feelings to your high school crush, mixtapes gave you that outlet.

Each mixtape was crafted with personalized songs, colors, messages, stickers, and stories. As cassette tapes and CDs have nearly disappeared, the mixtape has too.

Digital Mixtape brings the mixtape experience back to the digital space.

Users are able to login through Spotify and create a playlist, add tracks, and then personalize their mixtape by adding a background color, changing font styles and colors, adding images, crafting a personal message, and picking a sticker theme. Once their mixtape is just right, they can share it via social media.
